The Open Data Toronto Explorer is designed to explore data available on the [City of Toronto Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/). It's built off the [`opendatatoronto` R package](https://sharlagelfand.github.io/opendatatoronto/) and the code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/odtexplorer).
